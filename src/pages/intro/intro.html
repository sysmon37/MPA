            <h2>Patient Engagement</h2>
            <p>We are hoping that the activities that follow will help you understand how you can become better at managing your atrial fibrillation (AFib). We call that being an engaged patient. As an engaged patient, you will be committed and in charge of seeking information about AFib, relevant therapies and consequences of deviating from them (i.e., non-adherence). For example, you will understand how your risk of stroke will change if you take different medications, and how it will be affected by non-adherence or by eating habits. An engaged patient is an informed patient. When you become informed, you would be able to weigh in all aspects of your AFib treatment, to decide what to do if you missed a dose and how eating habits may increase your risk of blood clotting. You would understand when you need talk to your provider about changing or modifying your treatment, or what you should be watching for.</p>
